# FinTech_Challenge_6
Mapping SF housing using hvplots and gathering and cleaning the data using pandas
    We bring in data and clean it / combine it for the purpose of mapping out 2 plots:
        1: an interactive line plot that shows each neighborhood's gross rent trends over time and sales price/sq.ft. over time
        2: an interactive scatter plot over the city of SF that visually shows gross rents and sales averaged over the time period
            The size and color of each circle provides info on the Neighborhood
            You can zoom in and out on the map as well if neighbhoods are bunched up
            Lastly, by hovering your mouse over the circle, you can see more info on that neighborhood

Technologies: pandas version 1.4.2, hvplot version 0.7.3, pathlib version 1.0.1

Installation Guide: Make sure you have the dependencies installed
